# About Me (Lion Kimbro)

## Aspirations

My aspiration here (in Lion's Internet Office) are:
* to be available for discussion with others on the Internet, for any purpose
* to share and relate my research interests, and cooperate with people with the same or related interests

## Research Interests

My research throught my life can be divided into two major categories:

1. Life & Society & Imagination
2. Computers & Programming & Records

My work in this repository (Lion's Internet Office) and conversations on Discord presently center around #2 (Computers & Programming & Records), but the center of my life is truly #1 (Life & Society.)

## Research: Life & Society & Imagination

(Note, for those who are uninterested in this topic, please just skip forward.)

Specifically, I've dedicated my life to the development of Visionary Societies.  I live in a real-life community [(Star Community)](http://star-community.org/) based in Seattle, WA, that is the "living surface" of my work in and on community and visionary societies.  We are roughly 20 adults and 2 children living together in Seattle, proximate Renton, and we have been together ~7 years at the time of this writing (2021-09-05.)

**Visionary Societies** I define as  real-life "we-love-together" societies that are particularly focused on visionary aims -- extraordinary ideas, spiritual in nature, persued with material activity.  Visionary ideas come from the soul and the soul is an active space of exploration for all visionaries, and thus dreams and the arts are specifically pursued, not for the purpose of creating "decoration pieces," but rather as the necessary activity of creative encounter.

Visionary societies are fundamentally propelled by a mystery school, or some kind of a **spiritual philosophy**, and so I will share mine here:  I believe that life is fundamentally good, and that we and the universe are proceeding through an infinitely long process of transformation in the direction of the fulfilment of the divine heart, which is a heart that you can truly see your own reflection in.  However, this process does not happen "by itself," and requires our direct involvement.  It is entirely possible that we can "go backwards;" There *is* such thing as evil and loss.  I believe in God.  I also believe that creation is fundamentally *unfinished,* and that how we direct our hand matters.  I believe that dreams and conscience reflect the divine heart, and are trustworthy guides for our living choices.  I encourage all efforts, wherever they arise, whether large or minute, that work in the name of the spiritual evolution of humankind and life itself, and condemn every form of evil.  I categorize my philosophy as a "social existentialism."

I also feel the need to explicitly name the space of **human sexuality** as a point in particular need of humane attention and development.  I believe strongly that this is a place where we are all particularly wounded in our hearts, and that the consequences of this are far-reaching, perhaps even universally reaching -- from our feelings about ourselves, to the life of our communities and families, to our religions, to our political governments, to our working places and professional bodies -- I observe that it seems that there is no space that is not affected by unresolved needs and longings in sex and love.  If you are interested in further information about this topic, I would like to refer you to [the community of Tamera in Portugal,](http://tamera.org/) to the Terra Nova Network (an online community of people, which I will locate more information about, to link to from here -- I don't think it has a website presence yet -- 2021-09-05,) and welcome conversation in our Discord (which, another TODO: need to share information about here online. -- 2021-09-05)

**Community** is absolutely fundamental to my vision of life - not just as a fun place to be, but as a fundamental organ of life.

I particularly study these visionary societies and communities:
* [The Federation of Damanhur](http://damanhur.org/) in Italy
* [Tamera](http://tamera.org/) in Portugal

I have not studied, but also note, the visionary community of Synergia:
* [Synergia](https://synergiaranch.com/about-us/) in New Mexico (USA)

There are many other communities and societies that I have connection with or have studied, they specifically include:
* [the Bruderhof](https://www.bruderhof.com/), globally located
* [Ganas](https://www.ganas.org/) in New York (USA)
* [Twin Oaks](https://www.twinoaks.org/) in Virginia (USA)

I live in Star Community, and I (and we) have several personal connections with people living at Songaia in Seattle.

## Research: Computers & Programming & Records

The immediate (2021-09-05) focus of my work here, of late, is on my research into computers, programming, and records -- records of all kinds.

* notebooks, notekeeping
  * note: I am the author of [How to Make a Complete Map of Every Thought You Think (2003)](https://users.speakeasy.net/~lion/nb/book.pdf)
* visual language
  * drawing particular attention to the work of Robert Horn [(homepage)](http://www.bobhorn.us/) [(his book: Visual Language: Global Communication for the 21st Century)](https://www.amazon.com/Visual-Language-Global-Communication-Century/dp/189263709X)
* power
  * Q: "How do programmers do *far* more with *far* less?"
* notation
  * in particular, notation for expressing software code, and notation for the representation of data
* user interfaces
  * Q: "How do we make it easy for programmers to work with User Interface systems?"
    * an example of a powerful user interface system is Hypercard -- see [Wikipedia:HyperCard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HyperCard); [YouTube:Justin Falcone, 1991, presenting Hypercard](https://youtu.be/8i60_REoeIY?t=298)

I believe that our use of computers is in its infancy.  I believe that the mainstream of the programming industry is fairly dogmatic in character and fad-driven;  Thus I often find insight and "new" paths suggested by work performed in the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s -- though there are certainly plenty of innovative and ground-breaking things happening in contemporary work.

I believe that GOTO's can be okay, that object orientation is no kind of panacea, that notation is far more important than is popularly recognized, that interactivity is fundamental and should be treated as such, and that there is nothing nearly so reusable as a well-expressed idea: **the clear expression of ideas from human to human is the most powerful vehicle of reuse, ever.**  I find beauty and clarity in simple imperative code; I draw ideas from but am not attached to any particular paradigm, especially not dogmas such as object oriented programming or procedural programming.

I am a programmer as a way of life.  I first started programming computers when I was 6 years old, today I am 44 years old, and I have found the questions and possibilities in programming endlessly fascinating.  I lament the lack of widespread programming societies that focus on the development of advanced systems from a place of lifetime commitment, real-life integrated community, and research & development, relatively independent of commercial emphasis.  I want us to structure and organize our efforts as life-long programmers in loose but deliberate bodies.  Not guilds focused on establishing professionalism (which I see as dogma), but rather in associations focused on creativity, inspiration, and adventure.

I focus on what I call "visionary programming," and this interest is not completely detached from my interest in visionary societies.  I routinely draw attention to the work of [Douglas Engelbart,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Engelbart) [Alan Kay,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Kay) and [Bret Victor.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bret_Victor)

There are many much lesser-known computer programmer's that I find of particular interest.  I often dream of a society of life-time committed programmers, who wish to share ideas, inspirations, 

## ADD/ADHD

A particular note about ADD, ADHD -- There are two things I need you to understand, if you are relating with me.

1. **In live interaction: Please don't speak a lot of words in rapid-fire, and expect that I can keep up with you.**  Something in your first half of your first sentence will catch my attention, and I'll immediately start thinking about _that,_ and then I'll be unable to keep up with the other things you are saying.  For best results, tell me "I need to communicate to you a complex idea," and then lets work at it incrementally.  Communicate the first part, get a confirmation from me that I understand it, and then communicate the second part, get a confirmation that I understand, and let's continue on until the full idea is expressed.  Then say, "OK, I've now fully expressed myself," and then we can have a conversation about the entire thing.
2. **Please don't take it too personally if I miss an appointment, or have said that I will do something, and then completely forget about it, or get derailed with something entirely different.**  Please do feel free to remind me, or to redirect my attention to something, or to ask me about the status of something.  As part of my survival strategies, I've adapted myself to kindly take redirection from others.

I have the ADD thing of being **hyper-focused** on things that I am passionate about, un-focusable on things that I am not, and I rely on the help of those around me to help me navigate.  **I love being ADD,** even though it is both a profound strength and profound weakness, and frequently both endearing and madening for the people around me.

## Additional Notes

I have been in a life-long love affair with Japan, and actively study Japanese, which I speak at an A2 level.  My reading level is around N3.  I have been to Japan twice, and intend to visit for a period of several weeks at least once every two years.  I particularly focus on [東京](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo) and [秋葉原](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akihabara) specifically.

I have a daughter who is presently 20 years old, whom Amber and I named Sakura (桜,) though she goes by Silver today.  Amber and Silver are connected to the Star Community, though not part of it.

My favorite book is [The Golden Key](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Golden_Key_(MacDonald_book)) by [George MacDonald.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_MacDonald)  I encourage you to read it on [this Project Gutenberg Australia website.](http://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks07/0700571h.html)

## About Lion's Internet Office

I intend that there will be another page about "Lion's Internet Office," but I wanted to attach a brief note in this particular context of my 自己紹介, my self-introduction:

* All of these topics are welcome in my Discord.
* I look forward to meeting you, if you want to discuss anything.

I am always trying to figure out how to connect the two very different "hemispheres" of my life -- the community/social life, and the Internet/programming life.  I have not quite found that path.  Perhaps one day, the Star Community will be the Star Society, and there will be a visionary programming division, and I will spend substantial portions of my time working on programming projects and ideas within this particular segment of the society.
