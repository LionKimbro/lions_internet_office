Data Type:
  name?
    "article-postings-list-v1" (<-> $SCHEMA: "tag:lionkimbro@gmail.com,2021:schema:article-postings-list-v1")
  icon?
    picked out: "book_3"

  fields:
    + name: "UID" <-> "$UID" (w /a tag:.. identifier in it)
      type: "OneLineText" <-> (because it's a single tag value)
    + name: "SOURCE" <-> "SOURCE" (w/ a tag:... identifier in it)
      type: "OneLineText" <-> (because it's a single tag value)


PLACED BENETAH IT A HARD CODED "NAMEDLIST",
  Key: "ARTICLES" -- because that's the name of the list;


(alternatively, there could be a NAMEDDICT,)

Data Type:
  name?
    "article-posting-v1"  (SAME)
  icon?
    picked out: "write"

  field:
    +name: "AUTHORS"
      - SpacedText, # of lines: 5, BECAUSE: it takes a list of single line items (tags, specifically)
    +name: "HTML"
      - OneLineText, -- because it takes a URL
    +name: "RAW"
      - OneLineText, -- because it takes a URL
    +name: "POSTED"
      - OneLineText, -- because it's an ISO-8601 date

  output was set to {*POSTED*}, because it looked most aesthetic
